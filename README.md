## Hello, I am currently a student at University of California, Davis majoring in Data Science with a minor in Economics. Most of the time I work with large datasets and develop informational visualizations providing useful insights. I utilize a variety of algorithms and data structures to create a fast and efficient way to organize as well as search for data entries.
